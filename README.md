### Hey, I'am Ekman Kaur! 👏

Currently, I am working towards my undergrad in Computer Science/Information Technology. I enjoy working on Web Dev projects. I'm based in Washington, USA.

I am always trying to grow and learn something new. I commit to learning at least one new thing daily and usually lose track of time wanting to know more about the topic. 

### What I'm focusing on 💻📒

Currently improving my foundation web development skills and on a journey to learn full stack development while pursuing my education.
